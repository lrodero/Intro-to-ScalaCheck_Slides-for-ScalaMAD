# Intro to ScalaCheck - Slides for ScalaMAD
Slides of my presentation to [ScalaCheck](https://www.scalacheck.org/), for the Scala Programmers Madrid Meetup [ScalaMAD](http://www.meetup.com/Scala-Programming-Madrid/), 17th Nov 2015. You can read them [here](http://lrodero.github.io/Intro-to-ScalaCheck_Slides-for-ScalaMAD/).

These slides introduces *Property Testing* and how to define and check `Properties` with ScalaCheck. Also, `Generators` are discussed as they are a powerful tool not only for testing (as automatic sources of test cases) but in other escenarios as well. Besides, we comment ScalaCheck strategies for *Test Case Minimization* that help to find the 'smallest' test input that breaks some property, which is really helpful to debug code. Finally, we comment the relationship between ScalaCheck and Functional Programming.
